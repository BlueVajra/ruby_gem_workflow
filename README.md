## Details

This is my first workflow, so if you have any problems, please let me know. I will be improving and expanding this hopefully in the future to have similar functionality as kenshin's. This was inspired by kenshin's ruby gems... and not as pretty. https://github.com/kenshin54/alfred2-rubygems-workflow
